# Prisma Client Extension - Readonly Client

This example creates a client that only allows read operations like `findMany` and `count`, not write operations like `create` or `update`. Calling write operations will result in an error at runtime and at compile time with TypeScript.

## Caveats

Prisma Client extensions are currently in developer preview. This extension is provided as an example only. It is not intended to be used in production environments.

Please read [the documentation on `query` extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/query) for more information.
